	abstract = {This article investigates the implications of the Basel Convention’s amendments on plastics as part of the transition to a more sustainable global plastics economy where plastic wastes are seen as a valuable resource. Key categories of plastics continue to be excluded from the Convention, provided they are destined for recycling in an ‘environmentally sound manner’ (so-called {ESM} recycling). The exact interpretation of {ESM} recycling is worthy of attention as the way in which the term is applied reveals much about the kind of plastics economy that the Convention supports, which, as shown here, continues to risk mismanagement of plastic waste abroad. This article finds that, absent sound regulation, there is a need to reimagine the role of the country of export and strengthen its responsibilities to ensure the sound management of plastic wastes abroad.},

	abstract = {Electronic waste is recognized as the fastest growing hazardous waste stream of the twenty-first century. Because e-waste streams contain highly valuable precious metals and other secondary resources as well as hazardous toxic substances, the issue of their regulation lies at a liminal space between products and wastes. This complex legal interface engages the distinct and sometimes contradictory international regimes of liberalized trade and environmental protection. With most global flows of e-waste being treated by informal recycling industries in developing countries, and given the continued structural exclusion of these marginalized e-waste recycling sectors from official waste governance paradigms, the globalization of e-waste raises important environmental justice and North-South development issues. The present article examines the discussion of e-waste within international environmental law. In particular, it assesses new guideline developments under the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Waste and their Disposal. It is argued that despite its overarching objectives in relation to human health and environmental protection, the Basel Convention and the newly adopted Technical Guidelines on E-waste primarily ensure the continued circulation of obsolete electronic commodities in conditions that reproduce international externalities. The impossibility of this international environmental regime to foster any meaningful and authoritative notion of accountability over hazardous wastes that are generated through transboundary flows of 'products' inevitably limits its potential to curb the externalization of hazardous waste pollution to vulnerable populations who suffer the most acute health risks of global hi-tech production, consumption and reproduction. In essence, the success of this international regime over 'wastes' depends very critically on its coupling with national legislative controls over 'products' and more importantly, necessitates serious reflection on the legal dimensions of the notion of sustainable consumption.},

	abstract = {Circular economy is recognized as a powerful integrative framework envisioned to solve societal problems linked to environmental pollution and resource depletion. Its adoption is rapidly reforming manufacturing, production, consumption, and recycling across various segments of the economy. However, circular economy may not always be effective or even desirable owing to the spatiotemporal dimensions of environmental risk of materials, and variability of global policies. Circular flows involving toxic materials may impose a high risk on the environment and public health such that overemphasis on anthropogenic circularity is not desirable. Moreover, waste flows at a global scale might result in an uneven distribution of risks and costs associated with a circular economy. Among other benefits, circular economy needs to generate environmental advantages, energy savings, and reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. Recent attempts to implement the carbon neutrality strategy globally will likely push the circular economy further into more economic sectors, but challenges remain in implementing and enforcing international policies across national boundaries. The United Nations Basel Convention on the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste and their disposal is used here as an example to illustrate the challenges and to propose a way forward for anthropogenic circularity.},

The Convention initially opted for ‘restriction’ over ‘prohibition’ by establishing a regulatory scheme. This scheme allows any transboundary movement of hazardous and other wastes to proceed only when such movements adhere to the rules of the Convention under the Prior Informed Consent ({PIC}) mechanism and the observance of the environmentally sound management. It also provides a limited ban, prohibiting any transboundary movement between Party and non-Party to the Convention. However, Article 11 provides an exception for such prohibition if there is an agreement or arrangement between a Party and non-Party to the Convention which stipulates provisions that are “not less environmentally sound” than the standard of the Basel Convention.},

In the absence of formal obligations, regulatory instruments that have been communicated internationally and were already being practiced elsewhere were voluntarily emulated and adopted by policy makers. While the international promotion of regulatory instruments often facilitated their diffusion, the instruments’ characteristics determined the extent and speed by which regulatory instruments spread across countries. The voluntary adoption of regulatory instruments cannot be exclusively explained by the rational motivation of policy makers to improve effectiveness. In addition, they were motivated by concerns of legitimacy and perceived pressure to conform with international norms.},

Constructivists trace policy norms to expert epistemic communities and international organizations, who deﬁne economic progress and human rights. Coercion theorists point to powerful nation-states, and international ﬁnancial institutions, that threaten sanctions or promise aid in return for ﬁscal conservatism, free trade, etc. Competition theorists argue that countries compete to attract investment and to sell exports by lowering the cost of doing business, reducing constraints on investment, or reducing tariff barriers in the hope of reciprocity. Learning theorists suggest that countries learn from their own experiences and, as well, from the policy experiments of their peers. We review the large body of research from sociologists and political scientists, as well as the growing body of work from economists and psychologists, pointing to the diverse mechanisms that are theorized and to promising avenues for distinguishing among causal mechanisms.},

It proposes that the history of these negotiations can best be understood as a contest between two proposed framings that can be roughly characterized as “adaptation as development” and “adaptation as restitution.” These two framings have some similar and some contradictory implications for policy. The article shows that the major areas of consensus and controversy around adaptation in the {UNFCCC} negotiations map closely to these areas of similarity and contradiction, respectively. Though the “adaptation as restitution” norm is relatively disadvantaged on many measures of norm-fitness suggested by previous authors, it nevertheless appears to help explain the development of adaptation institutions both within and outside the {UNFCCC}. A hybridized norm that can be described roughly as “like development but different” is coming to characterize international adaptation institutions.},

But conceptually privileging these agents of change has meant the norm dynamics literature has become unbalanced and marred by case selection bias. Accordingly, an oppositional role – the ‘norm antipreneur’ – should be recognised to correct these problems. When the normative status quo in an issue-area is entrenched, a clear distinction can be drawn between the entrepreneurs and antipreneurs, because in these contexts the antipreneurs enjoy significant but under-appreciated tactical and strategic advantages. Recognising this enables the construction of a norm dynamics role-spectrum – a sort of ‘typology of roles’ – including ‘competitor entrepreneur’ and ‘creative resister’ in addition to the entrepreneur and antipreneur roles which actors might play in particular norm contestation contexts. Understanding these roles promises to improve analyses of the dynamic interactions between actors in particular norm contestation processes, thereby bringing greater overall balance to the norm dynamics literature.1},
